# QRPass

Create events, manage passes.

Made this while learning Django, during the early days of the lockdown. #productivity
It's got event pass generation, i.e. basic functionality from the flask application I previously made, for OYW.

You can create your events and passes, and customers receive an email with their QR-code based pass.
